For example, consider the Big O notation, \(\mathcal{O}\), defined as \(f(n) = \mathcal{O}(g(n))\) iff there exists a positive real number \(c\) and an integer \(N\) such that for every \(n \in \Z\), \(n > N\), we have \(|f(n)| \leq c g(n)\). This can be succinctly written as</p> <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{|f(n)|}{g(n)} < \infty.\end{aligned}\]</div> <p>In this post, I aim to expound on the concept of upper and lower limits so that the second formulation of Big O notation above becomes just as natural as the first one.</p> <h2 id=definitions ><a href="#definitions" class=header-anchor >Definitions</a></h2> <p>I start with some definitions.</p> <div class=def ><strong>Definition 1</strong>: A <em>sequence</em> is a real-valued function defined on the set \(\mathbb N\) of positive integers. If \(f(n) = x_n\), for \(n \in \mathbb N\), we denote the sequence \(f\) by the symbol \(\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb N}\), or simply \(\{x_n\}\), or sometimes by \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\).</div> <div class=def ><strong>Definition 2</strong>: A sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \((X, d)\) is said to <em>converge</em> if there is a point \(p \in X\) with the following property: for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n \geq N\) implies that \(d(p_n, p) < \varepsilon\). We write this as \(\lim_{n \to \infty} p_n = p\) or simply as \(p_n \to p\).</div> <div class=def ><strong>Definition 3</strong>: Let \(\{s_n\}\) be a sequence of real numbers with the following property: For every real \(M\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n \geq N\) implies \(s_n \geq M\). We then write \(s_n \to +\infty\). Similarly for \(s_n \to -\infty\).</div> <p><strong>Note</strong>: The symbol \(\to\) is now used for certain type of divergent sequences as well.</p> <div class=def ><strong>Definition 4</strong>: Given a sequence \(\{p_n\}\), consider a sequence \(\{n_k\}\) of positive integers, such that \(n_1 < n_2 < \cdots\). Then the sequence \(\{p_{n_k}\}_{k \in \mathbb N}\), which is a composition of the functions \(\{n_k\}_k\) and \(\{p_n\}_n\), is called a <em>subsequence</em> of the sequence \(\{p_n\}\). If \(\{p_{n_k}\}\) converges, its limit is called a <em>subsequential limit</em> of \(\{p_n\}\).</div> <div class=def ><strong>Definition 5</strong>: Let \(\{s_n\}\) be a sequence of real numbers. Let \(E\) be the set of numbers \(x\) &#40;in the extended real number system, i.e., \(x \in \overline{\mathbb R} := \mathbb R \cup \{+\infty, -\infty\}\)&#41; such that \(s_{n_k} \to x\) for some subsequence \(\{s_{n_k}\}\). Therefore, this set contains all the subsequential limits of \(\{s_n\}\) plus possibly the numbers \(+\infty\) and \(-\infty\). We define <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} s^* &= \sup E \\ s_* &= \inf E. \end{aligned}\]</div> The numbers \(s^*\) and \(s_*\) are called the <em>upper and lower limits</em> of \(\{s_n\}\) respectively. We use the notation <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} \limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n &= s^* \\ \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n &= s_*. \end{aligned}\]</div></div> <p>It immediately follows that \(s_* \leq s^*\).</p> <p>The fact that \(E\) is non-empty &#40;and thus taking \(\sup\) or \(\inf\) makes sense&#41; follows from the observation that either \(\{s_n\}\) is bounded or unbounded. If it is bounded then it must contain a convergent subsequence &#40;by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem&#41; and thus at least one element, or if it is unbounded then it must contain either \(+\infty\) or \(-\infty\).</p> <h2 id=some_useful_lemmas ><a href="#some_useful_lemmas" class=header-anchor >Some Useful Lemmas</a></h2> <p>Now let us prove some lemmas that will be useful later.</p> <div class=thm ><strong>Lemma 1</strong>: The subsequential limits of a sequence \(\{p_n\}\) in a metric space \(X\) form a closed subset of \(X\).</div> <div class=proof ><p>As before, let \(E\) be the set of all subsequential limits of \(\{p_n\}\) and let \(q\) be a limit point of \(E\). We have to show that \(q \in E\). To show this we will construct a subsequence of \(\{p_n\}\) which converges to \(q.\)</p> <p>Choose \(n_1\) so that \(p_{n_1} \neq q\). If no such \(n_1\) exists, then \(E\) has only one element, namely \(q = p_1 = p_2 = \cdots\), and there is nothing to prove. Define \(\delta = d(q, p_{n_1})\). Suppose \(n_1, \ldots, n_{i-1}\) for some fixed \(i \ge 2\) are chosen. Since \(q\) is a limit point of \(E\), there is a point \(x \in E\) with \(d(q, x) < \delta /2^i\). Since \(x \in E\), there is an \(n_i > n_{i-1}\) such that \(d(x, p_{n_i}) < \delta/2^i\). Thus <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} d(q, p_{n_i}) \leq d(q, x) + d(x, p_{n_i}) < \frac{\delta}{2^{i-1}} \quad \text{for } i = 1,2,\ldots.\end{aligned}\]</div> This implies \(p_{n_k} \to q\), showing \(q \in E\).</p></div> <div class=thm ><strong>Lemma 2</strong>: Let \(F\) be a nonempty closed set of real numbers which is bounded above. Let \(\alpha = \sup F\). Then \(\alpha \in F\).</div> <div class=proof >Assume for the sake of the contradiction that \(\alpha \notin F\). Then since \(F^\mathsf{c}\) is an open set &#40;because \(F\) is closed&#41; there exists an \(\varepsilon > 0\) such that \((\alpha - \varepsilon, \alpha + \varepsilon) \subset F^\mathsf{c}\). But this implies \(\alpha - \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\) is an upper bound for \(F\) which is smaller than \(\alpha\). This gives us our required contradiction.</div> <h2 id=properties ><a href="#properties" class=header-anchor >Properties</a></h2> <p>We now have all the tools to prove the highlight of this blog post, a very useful characterization of upper and lower limits.</p> <div class=thm ><p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>: Let \(\{s_n\}\) be a sequence of real numbers. Let \(E\) and \(s^*\) have the same meaning as previously.

Let&#39;s denote this set of \(n\)&#39;s with \(\mathcal{K}\) and let \(\{s_k\}_{k \in \mathcal{K}}\) be this subsequence. If \(\{s_k\}_{k \in \mathcal{K}}\) is unbounded then \(s^* = +\infty\) contradicting the fact that there exists an \(x > s^*.\) And if \(\{s_k\}_{k \in \mathcal{K}}\) is bounded that it contains a convergent subsequence &#40;by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem&#41;. Suppose this convergent subsequence converges to \(y\). Then \(y \geq x > s^*\). This contradicts the definition of \(s^*.\)</p> </ol> <p>To show the uniqueness, suppose there are two distinct numbers, \(p\) and \(q\), which satisfy the two properties, and suppose \(p < q\). Choose \(x\) such that \(p < x < q\). Since \(p\) satisfies the second property, there exists an integer \(N\) such that \(s_n < x\) for \(n \geq N\). But then \(q\) cannot satisfy the first property.</p></div> <p>An intuitive theorem:</p> <div class=thm ><strong>Theorem 2</strong>: If for two sequences \(\{s_n\}\) and \(\{t_n\}\) we have \(s_n \leq t_n\) for \(n \geq N\), where \(N \in \mathbb N\) is fixed, then <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n &\le \liminf_{n \to \infty} t_n \\ \limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n &\le \limsup_{n \to \infty} t_n. \end{aligned}\]</div></div> <div class=proof ><p>Let \(s^* = \limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n\) and \(t^* = \limsup_{n \to \infty} t_n\), as before. Suppose for the sake of contradiction \(t^* < s^*\). Choose \(x\) such that \(t^* < x < s^*\). Then by the second property of Theorem 1 there is an integer \(N_1\) such that \(n \geq N_1\) implies \(t_n < x\). Also by the first property of Theorem 1 there exists a subsequence \(\{s_{n_k}\}\) such that \(s_{n_k} \to s^*\). This implies that there exists an integer \(N_2\) such that \(n \geq N_2\) implies \(x < s_n\). But then for \(n \geq \max\{N_1, N_2\}\) we have \(t_n < x < s_n\). This gives us our required contradiction.</p> <p>A similar argument can be made for the \(\liminf\) case.</p></div> <p>Next we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of a sequence in terms of its \(\liminf\) and \(\limsup\).</p> <div class=thm ><strong>Theorem 3</strong>: For a real-valued sequence \(\{s_n\}\), \(s_n \to s \in \overline{\mathbb R}\) if and only if <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} \limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n = \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n = s.\end{aligned}\]</div></div> <div class=proof ><p>We divide the analysis into three cases.</p> <ol> <li><p>First, let \(s \in \mathbb R\). Then if \(s^* = s_* = s\), Theorem 1 implies that for any \(\varepsilon > 0\) we have \(s_n \in (s-\varepsilon, s+\varepsilon)\) for all but finitely many \(n\), which means \(s_n \to s.\) On the other hand if \(s_n \to s\) then every subsequence \(\{s_{n_k}\}\) must converge to \(s\) and hence \(s^* = s_* = s\).</p> <li><p>Now let \(s = +\infty\). Then \(s_n \to s\) means that for every \(M \in \mathbb R\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n \geq N\) implies \(s_n \geq M.\) This is same as saying \(s_* = +\infty\), which gives \(s^* = +\infty\) curtsy of Theorem 2.</p> <li><p>Lastly, let \(s = -\infty\). Then \(s_n \to s\) means that for every \(M \in \mathbb R\) there is an integer \(N\) such that \(n \geq N\) implies \(s_n \leq M.\) This is same as saying \(s^* = -\infty,\) which gives \(s_* = -\infty\) curtsy of Theorem 2.</p> </ol></div> <h2 id=upper_and_lower_limits_a_reprise ><a href="#upper_and_lower_limits_a_reprise" class=header-anchor >Upper and Lower Limits — A Reprise</a></h2> <p>There is an equivalent and often useful way to express upper and lower limits.</p> <div class=def ><strong>Definition 6</strong>: Let \(\{s_n\}\) be a sequence of real numbers.

The proof for the second is similar. We prove the equation in two steps.</p> <p>Let \(S = \{ s_n : n \in \mathbb N \}\). Let&#39;s show that \(\sup S = +\infty\) if and only if \(s^* = + \infty.\) Suppose first that \(\sup S = + \infty.\) Then we construct a subsequence \(\{s_{n_k}\}\) as follows. We let \(n_1 = 1.\) Suppose \(n_1, \ldots, n_{k}\) for some fixed \(k \ge 1\) have been chosen and let <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} S_k = \{ n \in \mathbb N : s_n \geq \max\{s_{n_1}, \ldots, s_{n_k}, k\} + 1 \}.\end{aligned}\]</div></p> <p>Notice that \(S_k\) is infinite as otherwise we can find an \(M \in \mathbb R\) such that \(s_n \leq M\) for all \(n \geq 1\), contradicting the fact that \(\sup S = + \infty\). We pick \(n_{k+1}\) to be the smallest element of \(S_k\) which is bigger than \(n_k.\) The resulting subsequence satisfies the condition that \(s_{n_k} \geq k\) for \(k \geq 2\) and thus we conclude that \(s_{n_k} \to +\infty\) which gives \(s^* = +\infty.\) Now suppose that \(s^* = +\infty.\) From Theorem 1 we can conclude that there exists a subsequence \(\{s_{n_k}\}\) such that \(s_{n_k} \to +\infty.\) This immediately implies \(\sup S = +\infty.\)</p> <p>For the second step, suppose \(\sup S < + \infty.\) Denote <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} a_n = \sup_{k \ge n} s_k.\end{aligned}\]</div> Notice that \(a_1 < +\infty\) and \(\{a_n\}\) is a monotonically decreasing sequence. Therefore, we have that either \(\{a_n\}\) is lower bounded, in which case it converges to, say, \(a,\) or it is not, in which case \(a_n \to -\infty.\) Since \(s_n \leq a_n,\) by Theorem 2 we can conclude <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} s^* \le a^* = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n,\end{aligned}\]</div> where the last equality follows from Theorem 3. We will now show that <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} s^* \ge \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n,\end{aligned}\]</div> which will give us our required equality. If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = -\infty\), there is nothing to prove and so we assume that \(a > -\infty.\) Let \(\varepsilon > 0\) be given and define <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} B := \{ n \in \mathbb N : s_n \ge a - \varepsilon \}.\end{aligned}\]</div> We claim that \(B\) is infinite. Indeed, if \(B\) were finite we could find \(N \in \mathbb N\) so that \(N \geq \max B.\) This will imply that \(s_n \le a - \varepsilon\) for all \(n \geq N\) and so \(a_n \leq a - \varepsilon\) for \(n \geq N.\) But then by Theorem 2 we would conclude \(a = \lim a_n \leq a-\varepsilon.\) Thus \(B\) is infinite and we let \(\{s_{n_k}\}\) be a subsequence of \(\{s_n\}\) with \(n_k \in B.\) Notice that \(\limsup_{k \to \infty} s_{n_k} \leq s^*,\) since any subsequential limit of \(\{s_{n_k}\}\) is also a subsequential limit of \(\{s_n\}.\) This along with Theorem 2 give <div class=nonumber >\[\begin{aligned} a - \varepsilon \le \limsup_{k \to \infty} s_{n_k} \leq s^*.\end{aligned}\]</div> Since \(\varepsilon\) was arbitrary we conclude that \(s^* \ge a\), which is what we wanted.</p></div> <h2 id=more_properties ><a href="#more_properties" class=header-anchor >More Properties</a></h2> <p>These theorems make it easier to discover more properties of upper and lower limits.</p> <div class=thm ><strong>Theorem 5</strong>: Let \(\{s_n\}\) be a sequence of real numbers.
