One of the goals of this expository blog post is to convince the reader that Baire category theorems are a worthwhile addition to their toolkit. The other goal is to simply indulge in the study of Baire spaces for it is beautiful mathematics.</p> <h3 id=small_sets ><a href="#small_sets" class=header-anchor >Small Sets</a></h3> <p>What is a “small” set? This question can have multiple answers depending on whom you ask. For a set theorist, a countable set is small, while for an analyst, a set of measure \(0\) is small. We will see that for a topologist the ideas of nowhere dense set and meager set encapsulate the notion of smallness. These different notions of smallness don&#39;t always coincide though. For example, Cantor set is an uncountable set having Lebesgue measure \(0\), and as we will see in Section <a href="/otium/baire#prerequisites">2</a> it is also nowhere dense in \(\mathbb R.\)</p> <p>Using this topological vocabulary for small sets we will define the notion of a Baire space, which in this vocabulary aren&#39;t small. Many well-behaved classes of spaces are Baire. Among the most well-known are locally compact Hausdorff spaces and complete pseudometric spaces. This is the content of the famous Baire category theorems which will be the highlight of this blog post.</p> <p>These Baire category theorems are a powerful class of results useful for proving existence. We will see in Section ?? how they can be applied to prove existence of objects of desired property. The main idea which these applications follow is to first construct a set \(X\) in which we want to prove there exist elements satisfying a certain property, and then show that elements <em>not</em> satisfying this property, in fact, form a small set.</p> <h3 id=warm-up ><a href="#warm-up" class=header-anchor >Warm-Up</a></h3> <p>As a warm-up to the kind of arguments we will be dealing with let&#39;s show that every nonempty compact Hausdorff space with no isolated points is uncountable. This will in particular show that \([0,1]\) is uncountable.</p> <p>We first show that given any nonempty open set \(U\) of \(X\) and any point \(x \in X\), there exists a nonempty open set \(V\) contained in \(U\) such that \(x\) is not contained in the closure \(\mathrm{cl}_X(V)\) of \(V\) in \(X.\) If \(x \in U\), then since \(\{x\}\) is not open, \(U\) must contain a point different from \(x.\) On other hand, if \(x \notin U\), then since \(U\) is nonempty it must contain a point different from \(x.\) In either case denote this point by \(y.\) \(X\) is Hausdorff, and therefore we can choose two disjoint open subsets \(W_1, W_2\) of \(X\) such that \(x \in W_1\) and \(y \in W_2.\) Then let \(V = W_2 \cap U.\) It is an open set contained in \(U\), it is nonempty because it contains \(y\), and its closure does not contain \(x.\)</p> <p>To finish proving that \(X\) is uncountable we show that any given function \(f \colon \mathbb N \to X\) is not surjective. Let \(x_n = f(n).\) Apply our result above to the nonempty open set \(U = X\) to choose a nonempty open subset \(V_1\) of \(X\) such that \(x_1 \notin \mathrm{cl}_X(V_1).\) In general, for each \(n \in \mathbb N,\) given nonempty open subset \(V_{n}\) of \(X\), choose \(V_{n+1}\) using the result above such that \(V_{n+1} \subseteq V_n\) and \(x_{n+1} \notin \mathrm{cl}_X(V_{n+1}).\) We get a nested sequence</p> <div class=nonumber >\[ \mathrm{cl}_X(V_1) \supseteq \mathrm{cl}_X(V_2) \supseteq \cdots \]</div> <p>of nonempty closed subsets of \(X.\) Now recall the classical result that a topological space \(X\) is compact if and only if for every collection \(\mathcal{C}\) of closed subsets of \(X\) having the finite intersection property &#40;i.e., every finite sub-collection of \(\mathcal{C}\) has nonempty intersection&#41;, the intersection \(\bigcap_{C \in \mathcal{C}} C\) is nonempty &#40;See Proposition ?? for a proof&#41;. Therefore, there exists a point \(x \in \bigcap_n \mathrm{cl}_X(V_n).\) Now \(x\) cannot equal \(x_n\) for any \(n \in \mathbb N,\) since \(x\) is in \(\mathrm{cl}_X(V_n)\) but \(x_n\) is not. Therefore, \(f\) is not surjective.</p> <p>We showed that \(X\) cannot be written as a countable union of singletons. A compact Hausdorff space is \(T_1\), i.e., for any \(x \in X\), the singleton \(\{x\}\) is closed. We will show later that the singletons \(\{x\}\) in this case are what is called nowhere dense, and that \(X\) cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets. This is exactly the content of Baire category theorems, and therefore we could have concluded uncountability directly from these theorems.</p> <h2 id=prerequisites ><a href="#prerequisites" class=header-anchor >PREREQUISITES</a></h2> <p>In this section we give a brief tour of the prerequisites from point-set topology, mainly for notational convenience. For a more comprehensive treatment see the excellent textbooks <span class=bibref ><a href="#munkres">(Munkres, 2000)</a>, <a href="#willard">(Willard, 2004)</a>, <a href="#engelking">(Engelking, 1989)</a></span>.</p> <p>We start by recalling the notions of interior and closure which will be used in defining the notions of dense and nowhere dense sets in a topological space. As we mentioned before they provide a topological vocabulary to deal with “large” and “small” sets.
